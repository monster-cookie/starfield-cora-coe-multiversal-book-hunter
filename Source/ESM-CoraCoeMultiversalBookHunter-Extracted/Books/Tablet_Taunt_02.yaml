    Poor little lost Cora,


    As the universe spins its endless dance, I have observed you, a Starborn with a heart still beating with human fervor, seeking out the mysteries of the cosmos. It's time for your greatest challenge yet.


    Consider this an open challenge, from one who dwells in the shadows of the universe. I am a whisper in the dark space, an echo in the void where light fears to tread. I dare you to seek me out, to unravel the web I have woven across the stars.


    I reside in a realm forgotten by time, hidden within a labyrinth of dangers untold. This is no mere hideout; it is a fortress of nightmares, teeming with traps as cunning and lethal as the Starborn who guard it. These allies of mine are not simple foes; they are entities of power, bound to me by allegiance and fear.


    Your quest to find me will not be without peril. Each step you take will be watched, each move you make will be countered. Remember the Hunter and the lessons learned from him; what awaits you is far more treacherous.


    Do you possess the courage to face such odds, Cora? Will you risk it all, as your friends and colleagues once did? Your father's demise was a testament to the perils that lurk in the starlit abyss. Yet, maybe in your soul, there's a fire that burns brighter than the stars, a resolve to carve your own destiny.


    Embark on this journey, Cora. Prove your worth against the darkest corners of the universe. Let us see if the pupil can eclipse the mentor, if the explorer can outwit the architect of shadows.


    I await your arrival with bated breath.
