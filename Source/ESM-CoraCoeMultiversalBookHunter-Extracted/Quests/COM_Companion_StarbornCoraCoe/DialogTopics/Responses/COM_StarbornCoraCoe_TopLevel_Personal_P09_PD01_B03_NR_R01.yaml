    Value: 'Ah, books! They are indeed the vessels of infinite adventures and the gateway to boundless knowledge. You know, diving into the pages of a good book is like exploring a new planet, each page a step into unknown territories. My love for books, especially those on quantum theory, astrophysics, and, curiously enough, horses, has always been a part of who I am regardless of version. '

    Value: There's something about the tactile sensation of turning pages, the scent of ink and paper, that no digital screen can replicate. It's a sensory experience that connects me to the vast universe of ideas and stories.

    Value: And speaking of stories, they're not just a pastime for me; they've been a guiding light through my journey, especially in understanding the cosmos and the mysteries of the Starborn. Each book is like a star in the vast expanse of space, illuminating paths and revealing secrets of the universe.

      It's a passion that I've cherished since my days aboard my father's ship, a constant companion in my quest for knowledge and adventure. So yes, I am still very much an avid bookworm, collector, and each book is a treasured artifact in my personal universe. {{BETA NOTE -- This will eventually trigger Cora Wants All The Books}}
