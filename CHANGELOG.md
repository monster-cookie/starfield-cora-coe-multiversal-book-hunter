# Cora Coe, The Multiversal Book Hunter

## Version 1.0.8
* Uses Venworks Factions Overhaul 
* The stock Starborn Cora Coe look should not be same color skin (Need to reset her using CGF "CCMBH_Debug.ResetCora" preferably when in the Lodge)
* Known Bug: Starborn Cora is somehow being tied to Sam/Kid Cora and getting dragged to the ship when they are added as crew. 

## Version 1.0.7
* Found yet another "cave" PCM node generator making 5 total. Someone needs to tell BGS duplication in programming is very bad. No wonder som of the PCM cell requests have 10 copies.
* Also added the cache sites to the Natural Block list too as they spawn so many relative and are always the same
* Better compatibility with Venpi's Encounters Overhaul
* Removing the beta tag current stuff is stable but this is an ever evolving mod

## Version 1.0.6 (BETA)
* Added new planet and system for you to find. This will be where a lot of the main quest line and the end content will happen. Without CK2 or more REFL data parsing we can't land on the planets yet. :(
* Also is a static location for the cache dungeon (Again can't land on it and the POI doesn't reliably display nor does the other POI on the planet)

## Version 1.0.5 (BETA)
* Removed zone faction ownership so you can loot chests without pissing off your companions

## Version 1.0.4 (BETA)
* Added the new factions for the DLC. The Evil Player's is "Starfall Tyrants". Cora's faction will be introduced in the main quest line.
* For now the "Starfall Tyrants" are using Starborn armor set until I can find someone to do Texture work.
* Added a new cave location for the planet generation POI to use that spawn a Starfall Tyrants defended cache cave.
* The new defended cache location is set as a hard spawn on a specific planet also. 
* The new faction will also spawn in several random dungeons

## Version 1.0.3 (BETA)
* Added a new alternative look for Cora available as a patch

## Version 1.0.2 (BETA)
* BGS really failed aging Cora up I think this looks closer. Very open to feedback.
* Cleaned up player's book turn over prompts. They were Cora AI lines for some reason. 

## Version 1.0.1 (BETA)
* Imported Cora's book collecting quest, taking books from the player for gifts again. I'll redo the books and lines. 
* The dialog to trigger Cora's book collecting quest does so. To trigger the lines you need to run to do a NG+ reset or run the console command: CGF "CCMBH_Debug.ResetCora"
* Lots of updates to the in game help: CGF "CCMBH_Help.Show"
* MAJOR NOTE: Unless this is a new install, new game, or new NG+ universe; you will need to reset Cora using: CGF "CCMBH_Debug.ResetCora"

## Version 1.0.0 (BETA)
* Initial Release
* Cora is a completely stand alone companion based on the variant universe version of here combined with the hunter/emissary. 
* Cora Wants All the Books is not implemented yet but you will see in dialog where it will trigger
* The initial trigger quest for the DLC main quest is not implemented yet but you will see where it its going to be triggered in the dialog
* Only the support mage/sniper role is implemented again you will see dialog that will someday handle switching combat styles.
