# V1.0 Beta Permutations

## V1.0.3 (BETA)
* Added a new alternative look for Cora available as a patch

## V1.0.2 (BETA)
* BGS really failed aging Cora up I think this looks closer. Very open to feedback.
* Cleaned up player's book turn over prompts. They were Cora AI lines for some reason. 

## V1.0.1 (BETA)
* Imported Cora's book collecting quest, taking books from the player for gifts again. I'll redo the books and lines. 
* The dialog to trigger Cora's book collecting quest does so. To trigger the lines you need to run to do a NG+ reset or run the console command: CGF "CCMBH_Debug.ResetCora"
* Lots of updates to the in game help: CGF "CCMBH_Help.Show"
* MAJOR NOTE: Unless this is a new install, new game, or new NG+ universe; you will need to reset Cora using: CGF "CCMBH_Debug.ResetCora"
